# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

1. Objective A. Vessel segmentation using VMTK or another approach.

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->

1. Steve Pieper arranged for a VR visualization of QUTE-CE MRI data which worked very well. First time VR visualization!
1. Discussed with Daniel Haehn on VMTK in Slicer. We will follow up with a collaboration.
1. Discussed with Raoul Estepar on his scale space particle approach. We will follow up with a collaboration.
